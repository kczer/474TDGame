Timing aspect for each “area”
    Certain enemies will appear in certain areas/levels
    After a period of time, new enemies stop generating

Similar to Hordes of Orcs???
    Player has an “open area” to defend and can place defenses anywhere and create the path for the enemy to take
    Player has a path to defend and puts up defenses up to slow/damage/kill the enemy
